.TH SQ 1 LOCAL
.SH NAME
sq, unsq \- squeeze or unsqueeze a sorted word list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sq
< infile > outfile
.PP
.B unsq
< infile > outfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I sq
compresses a sorted list of words (a dictionary). 
For example:
.RS
sort -u /usr/dict/words | sq | gzip -9 > words.sq.Z
.RE
will compress dict by about a factor of 5.
.PP
.I unsq
uncompress the output of
.I sq.
For example:
.RS
gunzip < words.sq.gz | unsq | sort -f -o words
.RE
will uncompress a dictionary compressed with
.I sq.
.P
The squeezing is achieved by eliminating common prefixes, and replacing
them with a single character which encodes the number of characters
shared with the preceding word.
The prefix size is encoded as a single printable character:
0-9 represent 0-9, A-Z represent 10-35, and a-z represent 36-61.
.SH BUGS
.I sq
and
.I unsq
can only handle words of up to 256 characters.
The input must be sorted, and duplicates must be suppressed.
