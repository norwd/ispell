** List of all hash files (languages) which will be supported by ispell.
**
** This variable has a complex format so that many options can be
** specified.  The format is as follows:
**
**	<language>[,<make-options>...] [<language> [,<make-options> ...] ...]
**
** where
**
**	language	is the name of a subdirectory of the
**			"languages" directory
**	make-options	are options that are to be passed to "make" in
**			the specified directory.  The make-options
**			should not, in general, specify a target, as
**			this will be provided by the make process.
**
** For example, if LANGUAGES is:
**
**	"{american,MASTERDICTS=american.med+,HASHFILES=americanmed+.hash,EXTRADICT=/usr/share/dict/words /usr/share/dict/web2} {deutsch,DICTALWAYS=deutsch.sml,DICTOPTIONS=}"
**
** then the American-English and Deutsch (German) languages will be supported,
** and the following variable settings will be passed to the two Makefiles:
**
**	American:
**
**	    MASTERDICTS='american.med+'
**	    HASHFILES='americanmed+.hash'
**	    EXTRADICT='/usr/share/dict/words /usr/share/dict/web2'
**
**	Deutsch:
**
**	    DICTALWAYS='deutsch.sml'
**	    DICTOPTIONS=''
**
** Incidentally, it is rarely a good idea to include /usr/share/dict/web2
** in an ispell dictionary even if the file exists on your system,
** because it contains obscure words that may mask misspellings of
** more common words.
**
** Notes on the syntax: The makefile is not very robust.  If you have
** make problems, or if make seems to fail in the language-subdirs
** dependency, check your syntax.  The makefile adds single quotes to
** the individual variables in the LANGUAGES specification, so don't
** use quotes of any kind.
**
** The first language listed in this variable MUST contain a HASHFILES
** declaration.  That language will become the default for
** spell-checking if no dictionary is explicitly specified.  As a
** special (and kludgey) feature, if that language begins with
** "american" or "british", it will also be aliased to "english", and
** "english" will become the default dictionary.  (All of these
** defaults can be overridden by defining MASTERHASH, DEFHASH, and
** DEFLANG, but that should rarely be necessary.)
**
** On MSDOS systems, you must use names that are consistent with the
** 8+3 filename restrictions, or you will risk filename collision.  See
** the file pc/local.djgpp for details.
