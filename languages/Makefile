# Rewrite of fix8bit.c prompted by SuSE's ispell-3.2.06-languages.patch.
# I wanted to make sure the patch wouldn't break anything, so I wrote a
# test suite, but doing that I found lots of other things that were
# wrong, so I started trying to fix those...
#
# Makefile: fixed dependencies for fix8bit, added 'test' target.  The
# test suite checks fix8bit's pushback routines, runs test_fix8bit (see
# below) and checks a couple of additional properties: fix8bit -8 |
# fix8bit -7 == cat; fix8bit -7 | fix8bit -7 == fix8bit -7.
#
# fix8bit.c: rewrote to8bit() to better handle cases when the
# backslashed sequence turns out to be illegal.  The initial backslash
# is printed and the remaining characters are pushed back to be read
# again.  This means that for example \\x41 will print as \A, in the
# same way that !\x41 produces !A.  It also handles escape sequences
# cut off by EOF properly (again they are printed unchanged).  This uses
# a mini pushback library which has a test suite if you give main() the
# argument --test-pushback.  Also fixed the original problem with hex
# sequences being miscomputed, which SuSE wrote the patch for.  Added a
# warning if the input already contains 8-bit chars (that would stop
# -8 | -7 being identity).
#
# test_fix8bit: new file.  This is a Perl script to run fix8bit -7 and
# fix8bit -8 on every input file in test_data/ and check the results
# against the expected results also in that directory.
#
# test_data/: new directory.  Contains test cases, some written by hand
# and some randomly generated by rand_gen.  rand_gen tries to make 'well
# behaved' input that doesn't muck up fix8bit -8 | fix8bit -7 or other
# commands - but there are three flags you can use to tell it not to.
# The random test cases have not been checked by hand, so they should be
# used in addition to human-written ones.
#
# Revision 1.2  2001/10/05 14:22:30  epa98
# Imported 3.2.06.epa1 release.  This was previously developed using
# sporadic RCS for certain files, but I'm not really bothered about
# rolling back beyond this release.
