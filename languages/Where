Ispell is distributed with dictionaries and affix files for the
British and American variants of the English language.  For other
languages, you will need to download a dictionary and affix file for
each language.  (Affix files for languages other than English are no
longer distributed with ispell, due to the difficulty of keeping them
up to date.)

If you install your dictionaries and affix files into the proper
directories with correct Makefiles, you can add extra languages to the
"LANGUAGES" variable in local.h and your extra dictionaries will be
created automatically.  To help you with this task, ispell is
distributed with sample Makefiles for several common languages.

To find dictionaries and affix files, visit the ispell dictionaries
web page at:

This page is expected to move in the future, but a forwarding page
will remain.
