Version 3.4.02
==============

 - A major bug in 3.4.01 that caused incorrect behavior with many
   languages has been corrected.

 - The default maximum number of stringchars has been doubled.
 
 - Some spurious compiler warnings have been suppressed.

Version 3.4.01
==============

 - The english.aff file has been revised so that UTF-8 is now the
   default encoding for English dictionaries.

 - Some subtle bugs with the handling of stringchars, which were
   revealed by the changes to english.aff, have been corrected.

 - A new affix command, "options", has been added to allow selection
   of options related to a particular string character type.  There
   are currently two options, raw_display and squeeze_strings.  Both
   should be activated for UTF-8 encodings but few others.  This
   change causes hash files built with earlier ispell versions to be
   incompatible; old hash files will need to be rebuilt.

 - Over 6000 words have been added to the English dictionaries.  Most
   of them are in the english.xlg variant, but some are included in
   smaller dictionaries as well.  The English dictionaries also take
   advantage of the new UTF-8 encoding to support correct spellings of
   words adopted from other languages, such as crÃªpe.

Version 3.4.00
==============

 - The english.5 manual page has been dropped from the distribution;
   the english.aff file provides superior documentation (and in any
   case, most people will use munchlist to apply affixes).

 - Ispell now supports systems (BSD) that foolish discarded backwards
   compatibility and insist on using termios.

 - A function (getline) has been renamed in correct.c to solve
   compilation problems on some systems.

 - The manual page now correctly identifies the ispell version that it
   describes.

 - It is now possible to insert the ispell version information into
   shell scripts via the Makefile.

 - An error has been corrected in the English affix files that caused
   certain words ending in "th" to be pluralized incorrectly.  The
   dictionaries have been updated to ensure that no incorrect plurals
   have crept in.

 - The personal dictionary is now written in a stable order when there
   are multiple variant capitalizations of a word.

 - The security of temporary files has been improved on systems that
   don't have the "mktemp" command.

 - The deformatters makefile has been changed to be compatible with
   older versions of make.

 - A bug in TeX deformatting has been corrected.  Previously, two
   adjacent math-mode environments introduced with dollar signs, such
   as $a=b$$c=d$, would cause ispell to lose track of whether it was
   in math mode.

 - The Makefile now supports a DESTDIR installation prefix (patch from
   Petter Reinholdtsen)

 - The American and British Makefiles have been simplified to ensure
   that dictionaries are always built with the lastest information.

Version 3.3.02
==============

 - A Makefile bug has been corrected which caused the default hash
   file to be created under the wrong name.  If you installed 3.3.01,
   you should remove the file /usr/local/lib/ispell/english (or
   whatever your default language is, and in the appropriate
   directory) to clean up from the effects of this bug.

 - A bug has been corrected that caused ispell to allocate space for
   zero elements when initializing the expansion tables.

 - Hash files are now installed in reverse order of how they are
   listed in LANGUAGES.  As a result, the default american or british
   hash file is now that first listed in LANGUAGES, rather than the
   last.

 - A misspelling in config.X has been corrected.  This would only have
   affected Windows systems that didn't use the supplied local.h
   files.

 - EXEEXT is now printed by "ispell -vv".

 - The local.h.macos file now correctly leaves USG undefined.

 - There is now a local.h.cygwin file.

Version 3.3.01
==============

 - The default dictionary is now the first dictionary defined in
   LANGUAGES.  It is no longer necessary to define MASTERHASH,
   DEFHASH, and DEFLANG.  However, if you define those variables
   there, your definitions will be respected.

 - Count files are no longer used for dictionaries; this corrects
   problems with hash table overflows for some users who build
   multiple dictionaries.

 - If there is a directory named ~/.ispell_logs, ispell in
   command-line mode will create logs of your spelling corrections
   there.  These logs may be useful in identifying your common
   errors.  Someday, they may also be used for research into better
   methods of spelling correction.

 - A bug has been fixed that caused installation to fail because it
   referred to the nonexistent file "fixispell-a".

 - The pc/local.* files have been updated to choose consistent
   hash-file names.

 - A tiny portability problem in ispell.1X has been corrected.

 - DJGPP updates from Eli Zaretskii <eliz@gnu.org>:

	* deformatters/Makefile (PROGRAMS): Use $EXEEXT.

	* config.X (LINK): Define only if undefined.
	(EXEXT): New variable.

	* Makefile (install-basic, install-dictbuild): Use $$EXEEXT for
	systems where executable files have special extensions.
	(install-deformatters): Run config.sh and pass EXEEXT to sub-Make.
	(config.sh): Add EXEEXT to the list of variables put into
	config.sh.

	* pc/make-dj.bat: Sync with the new files and build commands.
	* pc/makeemx.bat: Ditto.

	* pc/djterm.c (tputs, tgetent): Fix return value according to
	prototypes on proto.h.

	* pc/cfglang.sed (PATH_SEPARATOR): Set to ":", since
	english/Makefile prepends to PATH using the ":" separator.

	* pc/README: Update DJGPP repository URL, versions of utilities,
	and other relevant information.

	* pc/local.djgpp: Update Eli Zaretskii's email address.
	(LINK): Set to "cp -p".
	(MAN4DIR): Delete.
	(MAN45DIR): New; define to point to DJGPP's man5.
	(INSTALL): Define to invoke `ginstall'.
	(OPTIONVAR, LIBRARYVAR): Remove, they are handled by config.X.
	(EXEEXT): New; define to ".exe".

 - Constructed files (config.sh and defhash.h) now depend on the
   Makefile, since changes in the latter often affect the contents of
   the former.  This is primarily of importance to the developer.

Version 3.3.00
==============

 - Item 4 in the license, which some people found objectionable, has
   been modified.

 - Ispell and the scripts now handle temporary files securely.

 - Sample local.h files are now distributed for several popular systems.
 
 - Support has been added for compiling under DOS/Windows.  See
   pc/README for information.  Note that Windows is still an
   unsupported operating system because I don't have a Windows
   development environment.  I will happily accept patches to correct
   problems under Windows, but cannot solve bugs myself.

 - External deformatters now work.

 - The two supplied deformatters have been renamed to defmt-c and
   defmt-sh.  This change is necessary to allow them to be built on
   stupid MS-DOS systems with limits on filename lengths.

 - A bug that could cause infinite loops when long lines were fed to
  ispell in "-a" mode has been corrected.

 - A number of misspellings have been removed from the English
   dictionaries, and new words have been added.

 - Command-line options can now be passed in the ISPELL_OPTIONS
   environment variable.

 - A CHANGES file is now being distributed.

 - A number of configuration options have been added.  See config.X if
   something isn't to your liking.

 - Workarounds have been added for POSIX stupidity that broke
   backwards compatibility.

 - Obsolete notes about special systems have been removed from the
   README.

 - A number of configuration options have been changed to have
   defaults that are more appropriate to modern systems.

 - TeX deformatting has been slightly improved.

 - A kludge has been added to deal with the fact that the German
   "ess-zed" character has no uppercase equivalent.  Previously, when
   ispell was presented with an all-uppercase word such as GROSS, it
   would suggest that same word as a correction.  It now accepts such
   constructs without complaint.

 - A number of portability improvements have been added.

 - Most ispell support programs and scripts now support the -w switch
   where appropriate.

 - A new expand option, -e5, has been added.

 - A new deformatting flag, -o ("ordinary" file) has been added.

 - The shell scripts now use /tmp for temporary files by default,
   since some systems (Mac OS X) don't have /usr/tmp and modern
   machines have plenty of space in /tmp.

 - An ancient syntax error in parse.y, long undetected by older
   versions of both yacc and bison, has been corrected.

 - When MASKBITS is set to 64, the characters "[\]^_`" are now allowed
   as flag characters.

 - On 64-bit machines, MASKBITS will always be at least 64.

 - The defaults for various constants (in particular, the maximum size
   and number of string characters) have been expanded so that ispell
   can support most European languages at the default settings.

 - The English dictionary now supports all the ISO Latin-1 characters,
   so that words borrowed from other languages can be spell-checked.

 - The English affix file contains sample declarations for accented
   characters encoded in HTML and UTF-8.

 - A bug has been corrected that caused ispell to hang when control-Z
   was typed.  Ispell also now correctly resets the terminal when
   suspended.  However, it still doesn't refresh the screen when
   resumed; fixing the latter problem is not easy.

 - Thanks to Ed Avis, the code in tgood.c has been improved a lot.
   (Many of the other changes, such as the -e5 switch, are also due to
   Ed.)

 - Ispell will no longer segfault under certain conditions if HOME is
   not in the environment.

 - Trailing whitespace is now trimmed from the names of files included
   by the &Include_File& feature.
